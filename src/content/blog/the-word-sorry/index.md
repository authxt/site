I have realized that the word 'sorry' has different versions, sometimes we just say it out of habit, like calling out for mom when we are hungry. sometimes we hesitate to say it because we know that we are not really sorry for our actions or whoever receivies the sorry doesn't deserve it or something. but there are times when you know that you really fucked up bad and wants the receiver to understand that we really feel sorry for the action. this feels so basic and simple, like everyone should know already, but still I realized the heaviness of the word sorry based on the situation or the circumstance.
