Ever since i made a blog section in my website, i wanted to replace the placeholders with actual writtings of mine but never did for about several months because the thought of starting to write a blog always worried me about it's quality, content of the blog, grammar etc. I finally caved in and decided to ignore all of those thoughts and just start with something. something is better than nothing right?
